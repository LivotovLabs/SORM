Retirement Notice
=================

This project is retired and no longer maintained.
I'm proud the SORM was the very first Hibernate-like ORM library for Android, simple, without boilerplate code and performant enough. It saved a lot of time and lines of code for me and other devs. But now we have better tools from built-in Room to NoSQL ones such as ObjectBox and Realm. 


# SORM

Simple yet powerful and lightweight ORM library for Android.
It was initially developed for internal projects to make our life a bit easier, but lately we decided to 
publish it for everyone.
